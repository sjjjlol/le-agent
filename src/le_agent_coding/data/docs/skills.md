# LeAgent skills and prompt templates

Skills provide reusable task knowledge. Prompt templates save prompts that users invoke by name.

## Skills

A skill follows the Agent Skills structure:

```text
<skills-dir>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

LeAgent loads user and project skills in increasing precedence:

1. `~/.le-agent/skills/`
2. `~/.agents/skills/`
3. `<cwd>/.le-agent/skills/`
4. `<cwd>/.agents/skills/`

LeAgent's own product knowledge is regular packaged documentation, not a built-in skill, so it does not appear in the user's skill list or compete with user skill names.

A higher-precedence skill with the same name overrides the lower one. LeAgent places only each skill's name, description, and path in the system prompt; the model reads the full file when its description matches the task. Use `/skill:<name>` for explicit invocation.

## Prompt templates

Templates load from user and project `.le-agent/prompts/` and `.agents/prompts/` directories. They are prompt shortcuts, not background knowledge, and may contain `{{ variable }}` placeholders.

Use a skill for reference know-how and a template for a frequently repeated prompt. Run `/reload` after changing resources in an active TUI session.

When modifying LeAgent's resource system, read `src/le_agent_coding/skills.py`, `src/le_agent_coding/resources.py`, and `website/content/guides/skills-and-prompts.md`, then test discovery, precedence, diagnostics, prompt formatting, and reload behavior.
