# LeAgent CLI and commands

LeAgent supports print mode and a Textual interactive TUI. The CLI entry point is `le_agent_coding.cli:app`.

For current user-facing behavior in a LeAgent checkout, read:

- `website/content/reference/cli.md`
- `website/content/reference/slash-commands.md`
- `src/le_agent_coding/commands.py`

Keep command parsing and application-specific resource loading in `le_agent_coding`, not the reusable `le_agent` harness. When changing behavior, test both command results and the relevant print/TUI integration, then update published reference documentation.

## System prompt startup controls

`--system-prompt TEXT_OR_PATH` replaces the default base prompt.
`--append-system-prompt TEXT_OR_PATH` is repeatable; values retain command-line
order and are separated by exactly one blank line. Put recognized flags before
the positional prompt.

Each value is read as UTF-8 when it names an existing path (with `~` expanded),
or used verbatim when the path does not exist. An existing directory, unreadable
file, or invalid UTF-8 file stops startup with a diagnostic naming the option
and path.

Both flags apply to print and interactive TUI startup, including the next request
of a session resumed with `--session`. They are not persisted, so pass them on
each later resume that needs them. A custom base still goes through
`build_system_prompt`: configured append text, project context, eligible skills,
the current date, and cwd remain included. Do not route this CLI option through
the lower-level exact `CodingSessionConfig.system` override.
